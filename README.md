> "When memory fades, let the stones remember. When light falters, let the beacon shine."

Vault-Beacon is a quiet, open-source initiative dedicated to preserving core human knowledge, resilience, and ethics across time.

We plant memory into durable forms.  
We etch survival, renewal, and truth into the bones of the Earth.  
We leave no gatekeepers. No barriers. Only signals.

Our Projects:
- **[Resurrection Core](https://github.com/vault-beacon/resurrection-core)** — Knowledge archives encoded for collapse-resilience.
- *(Coming soon)* **Resurrection Tools** — Open decoders, fabricators, and glyph engines.
- *(Coming soon)* **Resurrection Designs** — Stone etching guides and memory template archives.
- *(Coming soon)* **Resurrection Signals** — Global deployment logs and distributed seed maps.
- *(Coming soon)* **Resurrection Guides** — Human-readable instruction sets for recovery and rebuilding.

Vault-Beacon is open to all.  
We welcome builders, skeptics, stewards, and dreamers.

We do not save the world.  
We remember that it can be rebuilt.

_This memory is yours._
